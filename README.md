It's a fun text based guesssing game with cool in game features.

## Description

As a text-based/terminal game in which the player has to guess a random number
that is generated by the computer, __The Random Number Guessing Game__ has a 
hand full of cool features such as:
* different difficulty levels :
    * easy (default)
    * normal
    * hard
    * impossible (actually *not quite impossible*)
* separate highscore tables displaying the top 5 players for each level of
  difficulty
* a reset feature that allows players to erase kept highscores and get a 
  fresh start
* a clearing feature which flushes the text displayed on the console window
  because we all know how annoying a console full of text can be
* guides such as :
    * [rules](data/rules.txt) which teaches the player the basic
	   concepts of the game
    * [help](help.txt) which serves as a guide for using all the
	   commands that are featured in the main manu section of the game


## Usage

The game has an executable file [numberGuessing](numberGuessing.exe) generated
with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) that allows the player to open the game without 
having to install python or any additional modules.

When launching the game for the first time, it is recommended to type in the
console, the __help__ command:

``` 
You're on the main manu. Please give me your command:
(play, help, rules, highscore, difficulty, reset, clear, exit)
help
```

It will provide information regarding all the commands that can be used inside
the game.
