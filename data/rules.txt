	So my friend,
    
	    The Random Number Guessing Game is always played by
	the same 2 players : yourself my dear and I, your
	good old friend, the computer. :)
	    The game basically consists of me choosing a random
	number and then giving you a limited number of attempts 
	to guess it. If you succeed to reveal the number in less
	or equal number of attempts to those I gave you, then
	you'll win, otherwise unfortunetely, you'll lose.
	    In addition, in order to make your life way easier, 
	when the game starts I will tell you the number of 
	attempts you have available for guessing and I'll give you
	an interval from which I choose the secret number, the 
	length of this interval depending on which difficulty you 
	choose for yourself. I will tell you after every failed 
	attempt if the number you have to guess is lower or greater
	that the one you gave.
	    
	    Good luck!
